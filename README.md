# Dominos-Food-Ordering-App
This is a command-line food ordering system built in Python using SQLite for data storage. Users can sign up, log in, browse the menu, add items to their cart, and view the total bill — all from the terminal. It’s a beginner-friendly project to understand database integration, OOP concepts, and user authentication.
